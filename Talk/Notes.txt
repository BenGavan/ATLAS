LHC
 - bunches of protons in counter-rotating beams made to collide at the "interaction points"
 - bunch spacing = ...ns
 - luminosity =
   - =




ATLAS detector (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)



Cross section = the effective area of a chunk taken out of one beam, by each particle in the other beam, the subsequently
become the final state we are interested in. [Intro to QFT, Peskin and Schroeder, p101]

Branching ratio = The Branching ratio is a percentage chance that a particle will decay a certain way
                = is the fraction of particles which decay by an individual decay mode with respect to the total number
                  of particles which decay.
                  should be the same for ee mumu and tautau

Aims of the experiment

Abstract of results?

We used ATLAS data, so provide background on the experiment and how the detector works.

Intro to Z boson
 - basic processes we use to select

Include theory exercise

Initial plots to investigate Z (i.e.)

Justification for the cuts made for Z (Plots)

Calculation of cross section

Calculation of statistical uncertainty

Calculation of systematic uncertainty (plots of cross section with varying cuts)

------

Basic theory on the Higgs

Cuts made on the Higgs (physics justification)

Further cuts based on variables
 - For Z MC data (Z), 2 leptons are isolated and 2 "junk" from b
 - can therefore be removed via isolation variables
