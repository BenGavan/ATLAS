Aims of the experiment 

Abstract of results?

We used ATLAS data, so provide background on the experiment and how the detector works.

Intro to Z boson
 - basic processes we use to select 

Include theory exercise

Initial plots to investigate Z (i.e.)

Justification for the cuts made for Z (Plots)

Calculation of cross section

Calculation of statistical uncertainty 

Calculation of systematic uncertainty (plots of cross section with varying cuts)

------

Basic theory on the Higgs 

Cuts made on the Higgs (physics justification)

Further cuts based on variables
 - For Z MC data (Z), 2 leptons are isolated and 2 "junk" from b 
 - can therefore be removed via isolation variables
